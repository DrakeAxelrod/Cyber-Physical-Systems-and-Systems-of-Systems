#ASSIGNMENT
# - the project must be built and tested on any push to any branch in the repository except for new releases (ie., a tag)

# - the deployment stage must only be executed when making a new release (ie., a tag) but only when the project could be built and tested successfully

# - the deployment stage must only be executed when the tags to your repository follow semantic versioning (cf. background information here: https://semver.org (Links to an external site.) and https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/ (Links to an external site.)) according to the pattern
