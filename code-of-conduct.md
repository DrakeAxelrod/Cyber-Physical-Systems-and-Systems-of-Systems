# Code of Conduct

## 1. How do we plan to collaborate?
- Management Collaboration

  Team members are all familiar with the Agile way of working, and will be expected to perform according to some of its metrics. Stand-ups and flexibility when adapting to requirements are expected practices. Additional specified roles may be added as required in order to aid with a clear seperation of responsibility. 
  
- Coding Collaboration

  Pair programming is expected to take place, both remotely and on campus, in which case the colloborators will be noted on the commit.

  Doxygen will be used by the team in order to improve code readability.

  Code commits (not pushes) are expected daily during the work week.

  Coding practices will be in place such that the workflow will be modelled as the following: a card is created on the kanban board (Trello, a person will self-assign themselves to their issue they created on Trello, an issue will be created matching the issue on Git, and pull requests will be created referencing the issue. 
  
- Documentation Collaboration

  Trello will be used by the team to track progress on the project and increase traceability among the individuals within the team. 
  Doxygen will be used by the team in order to improve code readability. 

## 2. How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?

- Traceability

  By engaging in the sprint practices of having regular stand-ups thrice a week, members will be expected to give honest updates about their status. In addition to this, the Trello and code commits on Git will keep individual contributions noted.
  
- Code review will take place by all members of the team, meaning that every member should have an idea of the code being committed. 


## 3. How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?

- Pair programming (if and when it takes place) can help with knowledge transfer.

- If one or more team members are struggling, formal meetings will take place with the goal of bringing those target member(s) up to speed.

- Docstrings can be used to help reference understand the code from other team members. 


## 4. What is our usual communication plan?
- Communication will be held primarily on the chat platform Discord, with exceptions made for when meetings are arranged to be in-person    
  instead. Meetings in person will occur on average once a week, where we will have longer more formal meetings in order to track our progress and follow up on any issues/needs the team might have.

- Stand-ups will be held M/W/F; preliminarily, 10 AM is selected to be the expected meeting time, however that may change as per the team's 
  needs as the LP progresses.

- In the case that distance-only collaboration becomes necessary, meetings can continue to be held only through the Discord chat platform.

## 5. How will we solve conflicts? 
- Firstly, we aim to avoid conflict by being respectful and listening to each other. Our group members know each other from previous 
  projects that we have worked on and we feel comfortable to be open and honest about our work or personal situation at all times.

- Conflicts when they first arise should be discussed by the person(s) directly affected; if no resolution is found, it can escalate to the 
  group level. If there still can't be a resolution, it shall be escalated to the course responsible.
  
- Team meetings will be held outside of the stand-up meetings in order to have conflict resolutions should the need for intervention arise.
