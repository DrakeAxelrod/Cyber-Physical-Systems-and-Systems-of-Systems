### Concept Presentation Requirements

---

**MUST UPLOAD PRESENTATION 48H AHEAD OF TIME**

---

- What is your concept to detect cones? (hint: have a look at this assignment as input for your discussions: submit the URL to the Docker image of your final implementation
- What is your concept to determine the needed steering wheel angle?
- How does your software module integrate with the software modules that we provided to you?
- How do you test your algorithm?

#### Ideas

> Ways to solve the problem

- Machine Learning
- Interpret data, assign weights, makes decisions based on weights, test output
- Create a way in which to test the devised solution (if one is not provided)


> extensions

- Machine Learning

> analyze the data:

- determine how we can use the data available to us
- ultrasonic potentially super important?
- update rate
- 

> analyze the hardware limitations:

- frame rate of camera
- distance of sensors
- steering angle

> safety concerns:

- is it safe?
- how can we make it safer?
- what metrics can we provide?

> reading data:

- snapshot -> then move to a threading model (process for each sensor)


> thoughts

- CI/CD that runs simulation of steering based on provided data sets

## Next Meeting

- after class tuesday 29th march 2022
